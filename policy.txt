(2) based on our receipt of your payment of the premium.

DEFINITIONS USED THROUGHOUT THIS POLICY
In this policy, the words shown in bold type have the meanings stated below unless a different meaning is stated
in a particular coverage or endorsement. Words in bold type that are derived from a defined word have the same
root meaning. The plural version of a defined word has the same meaning as the singular if it is bolded. If any of
these same words are used but not printed in bold type, they have the meaning given them by their common
usage as set out in commonly used dictionaries.
1. Accident means an action or occurrence, or a
series of actions or occurrences, that:
(a) started abruptly,
(b) during the policy period, and
(c) directly resulted in bodily injury or property
damage.
If an action or occurrence that started abruptly
continues over a period of time and ultimately
results in bodily injury or property damage that
cannot be definitely attributed to any one specific
action or occurrence, all such bodily injury or
property damage is, under this policy definition,
only one accident. If a series of abrupt actions
or occurrences ultimately results in bodily injury
or property damage that cannot be definitely
attributed to any one specific action or
occurrence, all such actions and occurrences,
under this policy definition, constitute only one
accident.
Accident does not mean:
(a) an action or occurrence that any insured
intended to result in bodily injury, or
property damage, of any type;
(b) an action or occurrence that is intended by
2
any insured, if a reasonable individual
would expect it to result in bodily injury, or
property damage, of any type; or
(c) an intentional action by any person that
does not immediately result in bodily injury
or property damage, but ultimately does
result in such because of its repetition or the
repetition of similar actions.
2. Accidental direct physical loss means loss of
possession of, or actual physical damage to, a
part of the covered property which is caused by
an accident. It does not include:
(a) consequential economic damage resulting
from such physical damage to that part or
to the covered property as a whole,
(b) consequential economic damage resulting
from the inability to restore full monetary
value to that part or to the covered property
as a whole because of the fact that it has
sustained physical damage,
(c) consequential economic damage resulting
from the loss of use of that part or the
covered property as a whole,
(d) consequential economic damage resulting
from the inability to match the parts which
HO-4 (01-07)
are repaired or replaced with undamaged
adjacent parts, or
(e) any diminution of the pre-loss value of the
covered property after the repair or
replacement of its parts.
3. Actual cash value means total restoration cost
less depreciation. If the law of the state in which
this policy is issued limits the factors which may
be considered in determining the actual cash
value, only the factors allowed by such law will
be considered.
4. Bodily injury means:
(a) a physical injury;
(b) a sickness or disease of the body;
(c) the physical pain and physical suffering
which directly results from (a) or (b), above;
and

(b), above.
Bodily injury does not mean:
(a) a mental injury;
(b) a sickness or disease of the mind;
(c) mental anguish; or
(d) emotional distress;
unless such mental or emotional condition is
diagnosed by a medical doctor and directly
results from bodily injury to the individual on
whose behalf the claim is made.
5. Business means any activity for which the
person engaged in that activity receives
compensation of any kind, or reasonably expects

(b) the occasional rental or leasing, or the
holding for rental or leasing, of the
dwelling on the residence premises in
which you reside, for use as a dwelling;
(c) the rental or leasing, or the holding for

3

(d) a part-time activity, engaged in by you or a
relative, if the individual engaged in that
activity is under the age of twenty-five, and
is a full time student.
6. Claim means a request by any person for
benefits under this policy as a result of any one
accident. It includes lawsuits, requests for the
payment of money and requests that we take any
action, or extend any coverage, provided for by
this policy.
7. Compensation Law means any law under which
benefits are paid to a person as compensation
for the effects of bodily injury, without regard

operations reasonably necessary for such
production that are performed:

of money or goods.
Custom farming does not mean operations
performed as part of an exchange of farming
services so long as no other compensation is
paid.

attached to your dwelling. If a structure is
connected to the dwelling by only a utility
line or fence, it will not be considered
attached to the dwelling for purposes of this
definition.
11. Deductible means an amount of money
deducted from the total amount of all losses
covered under Section I of this policy, unless the
specific coverage under which a loss is covered
says otherwise. The amount of your deductible
is shown in the Declarations or in the specific
policy provision under which a loss is covered.
12. Depreciation means an amount of money that
is deducted from the amount we actually pay.
That amount is based on the decrease in the
value of the property since it was new. It applies
to any part that must be repaired or replaced
to allow for the repair or replacement of a
damaged part, whether or not that part itself is
damaged. The condition, age, extent of use, and
obsolescence of the part, and the property as a
whole, will be considered in determining
depreciation. Depreciation also applies to the
labor and applicable sales tax necessary to
complete covered repairs and replacements.
We will calculate the percentage by which the
materials necessary to the replacement have
decreased in value, based on the factors stated
above, and apply that same percentage when
calculating the depreciation applicable to the
labor and sales tax.

mechanical power, fuel, or electric current, which

coverage under this policy agrees not to institute
any legal action against us unless that person
has fully complied with all the terms of this
policy. Any legal action seeking a payment or a

HO-4 (01-07)

and the broader form will apply to your claims
after that date.
9
10. YOUR OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY US OF YOUR
CHANGES

In the event we make any payment under this
policy, we will be subrogated to all rights of

insured, or any other person receiving the

This policy applies only to losses, bodily injury

Section I, the insurance provided by this
policy will be prorated, based upon the
applicable limits of each policy, up to the
highest limit provided by any one policy. This
does not apply if a mortgagee, or trustee
under a deed of trust, has duplicate coverage
because of the ten-day notice provision
contained in the section related to mortgagees
and trustees. In that instance, the provisions
of that section respecting the priority of
coverages will control.
(b) With respect to all coverages contained in
Section II, the insurance provided by this
policy will apply only as excess insurance,
and will then apply only in the amount by
which its limits exceed the limits of all such
other policies.
15. OTHER SOURCES OF COMPENSATION FOR THE
LOSS
(a) If an insured is entitled to receive full
compensation for a loss covered by this
policy from another source, this policy will
not apply to such loss.
(b) If an insured is entitled to receive partial
compensation for a loss covered by this
policy from another source, this policy will
apply only to the amount of the loss for
which the insured is not entitled to
compensation from that source.
16. CONFORMITY TO APPLICABLE LAWS
If the terms of this policy conflict with the laws
of any state that are applicable to a covered loss,
the conflicting terms are amended to conform to
such laws.
17. EFFECT OF POLICY ACCEPTANCE
By acceptance of this policy, you agree that the
statements in the Declarations and in any
Application or Application for Change accepted
by us, are offered as an inducement to us to
issue, continue, or renew this policy, and are
your agreements or representations. They are
not warranties.
18. CONTINUOUS RENEWAL
Subject to our consent and subject to the
premiums, rules and forms then in effect for us,
this policy may be continued in force by payment
of the required continuation premium for each
successive policy term. Such continuation
premium must be paid to us before the

(a) repair or replace any part of a pair or set
to restore the pair or set to its market value
before the loss; or
(b) pay the amount by which the market value
of the pair or set has diminished because
of the loss of, or damage to, the part.
5. Loss Payable Clause
We will adjust any loss with you, and make any
payment due to you. However, if another person
is named in the Declarations as a “loss payee”,
we will include the name of that person on any
settlement check or draft and deliver it to you or
such loss payee, at our option.
6. Mortgagees and Trustees Under Deeds of Trust
We will adjust any loss with you, and make any
payment due to you. However, if another person
is named in the Declarations as a “mortgagee”,
or “trustee” under a trust deed, we will pay any
amount due to that mortgagee or trustee to the
extent of its interests. If the name of more than
one such person appears, we will pay them in
the order of precedence of their mortgages or
trust deeds. This provision does not apply to
19
HO-4 (01-07)
contracts for deed or any similar method of sale
in which ownership of the property does not
pass to the insured until all payments on the
purchase loan are made.
Any payment due to a mortgagee or trustee
under this provision will not be invalidated by:
(a) any act or neglect of the mortgagor or
owner of the insured property;
(b) any foreclosure or other proceedings or
notice of sale relating to the property;
(c) any change in the title or ownership of the
property; or
(d) the occupation of the premises for
purposes more hazardous than are
permitted by this policy.
If the mortgagor or owner neglects to pay any
premium due under this policy, the mortgagee
or trustee must pay it, immediately upon our
demand.
Any mortgagee or trustee must notify us of any
change of:
(a) ownership;
(b) occupancy; or
(c) increased risk of a loss to the insured
property;
of which it has knowledge within ten days of its
acquisition of that knowledge. The mortgagee or
trustee must also pay the additional premium for
such increased risk of loss for the balance of the
term of this policy. Failure to provide such notice
or make such payment will result in an
immediate loss of coverage to the mortgagee or
trustee.
We may cancel this policy at any time as
provided by its terms, however if we do so, it
will continue in force as to benefits due the
mortgagee or trustee for 10 days after notice is
mailed to the mortgagee or trustee of such
cancellation. At the end of those 10 days all
benefits under this policy will end. This provision
does not apply to loss payees.
If another policy of insurance provides coverages
similar to those provided in Section I of this
policy, the benefits provided under this policy will
apply as excess only over those provided by
such other policy. In that instance, benefits will
be payable under this policy only to the extent
the limits of the coverage provided under this
policy exceed the limits provided by the other
policy.
If we pay the mortgagee or trustee any sum for
loss under this policy, and we contend that we
had no obligation to pay the mortgagor or owner,
we will be subrogated to all of the rights of the
party to whom such payment is made to the
extent of such payment. Our interest will extend
to all securities held as collateral for the
mortgage debt. Any mortgagee or trustee so paid
agrees to sign whatever documents and take
whatever actions we may reasonably request to
enforce our rights under this provision. Our
subrogation rights will not be enforced in such
a way as to impair the right of the mortgagee or
trustee to recover the full amount due under the
mortgage.
If we pay the mortgagee or trustee any sum for
loss under this policy, and we contend that we had
no obligation to pay the mortgagor or owner, we
may, at our option, pay the mortgagee or trustee
the entire principal sum of the loan, with interest
accrued to the date of payment and, if we do so,
that person agrees to make a full assignment and
transfer of the mortgage or trust deed and all other
securities applicable to the loan to us.
7. Suit Against Us
Any lawsuit seeking coverage or benefits under
Section I of this policy must be brought within
one year after the loss or damage occurs, unless
the law of the state in which this policy was
issued prohibits this contractual limitation
period. This period is extended by the number
of days between the date of your loss and the
date we deny the claim in whole or in part.
20
HO-4 (01-07) 21
8. No Benefit to Bailee
This insurance will not, in any way, benefit any
person who may be caring for or handling
property for a fee.
9. Recovered Property
If you recover any lost or stolen property for
which we have made a payment under this
policy, you agree to notify us of that fact within
ten days of its recovery. If you want to keep the
property you may do so if you return the entire
amount we paid you because of its loss. If you
do not want to keep the property, you agree to
allow us to take it, if we chose to do so. In that
event the property will become our property.
If we recover any lost or stolen property for
which we have made a payment under this
policy, we agree to notify you of that fact within
ten days of its recovery. If you want the property
you may take it if you return the entire amount
we paid you because of its loss. If you do not
want the property, you agree to allow us to keep
it, if we chose to do so. In that event the
property will become our property.
10. Payments Under This Section Of The Policy
Before we make any payments under Section I
of this policy,
(a) we must receive your completed proof of
loss;
(b) you must comply with all conditions of this
policy; and
(c) the amount of the loss must have been
established by either:

(2) a final judgment of a court of law.

any payments due for a covered loss within 30
days.

to whether the goods and services are necessary
goods and services. The determination of
whether goods and services are necessary
goods and services may be made after the

reasonable charges. The determination of
whether charges are reasonable charges may be
made after the individual making the claim has
